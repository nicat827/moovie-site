# 🎬 Moovie Site

**Moovie Site** is a small frontend project I built during my **Code Academy** program.  
We were given **one week** to create a frontend application using HTML and CSS. The course primarily focused on backend development, and the frontend part was taught only at a basic level.  

Since I already had some **frontend experience**, I decided to build a **movie site using React**, going beyond the basics taught in the course.

## 🚀 Features

The Moovie Site includes:

- 🎥 Display of movie titles and information  
- 🖼️ Movie posters and visuals  
- 🧩 Interactive layout and responsive design  
- ⚛️ Built entirely in **React** for dynamic frontend behavior

## 🧠 About the Project

This project was created to:

- Practice frontend development using **React**  
- Apply CSS and HTML skills to create a visually appealing website  
- Experiment with component-based architecture in a short time frame  
- Combine backend understanding from the course with frontend implementation  

Even though it was a one-week challenge, I managed to implement a **fully functional movie site** with React and clean component structure.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Importance of **component reusability** in React  
- How to integrate **dynamic content and state**  
- Organizing a project quickly under a tight deadline  
- Combining prior frontend knowledge with newly learned concepts
